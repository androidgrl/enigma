As a user
When i enter 'ruby ./lib/encrypt.rb message.txt encrypted.txt' from the command line
it will will run the encrypt.rb file and take the text inside message.txt and encrypt it and then
write it into encrypted.txt
And then it will output the following to cmd "Created 'encrypted.txt' with the key 82648 and date 030415"

How is the message encrypted?

Offset class:
Takes the current date in the following format 030315, makes it into an integer and then squares it
and then takes the last four numbers.  Then the last four numbers get put into a Hash
a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4

Rotation class:
Takes a randomly generated five digit number (the key) and then creates the rotation numbers
a: 24, b:32, c:12, d:4


Add offset and rotation together and get the total rotate number
a:25, b:34, c:15, d:8

Then to encrypt a message:
"test"

The rotator class:

Uses the map key, takes in a letters, the rotation of the letter and the offset of the letter,
it adds the offset and the rotation together to get the total_rotation, then find the letter
on the map and shift total_rotation positions up from the letter to get the encrypted letter.
*you will need to figure out how to wrap around the map so that you don't run off the map

The Encryptor class will take in a string break it
up into groups of four.  Then each letter in the group will correspond to a, b, c, d repsectively
and will have it's respective total_rotation.  Then it will use the rotator class to convert the letter
into it's encrypted letter.  And it will do the same for every letter in the message.






rules: no capitals, only punctuation marks



  I need a class to read 'message.txt' - text = FileReader.new(message.txt)
    Then send that text as a string to (Encrypt(text, )) class

Then I expect to receive a message 'Created 'encrypted.txt' with the key 82648 and date 030415'
